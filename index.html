	<h1>Brandi Flink</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in Omaha, NE. I am the proud mommy of my one year old son, Nixon and expecting another bundle in March 2017. For the last 8 years I have worked as a graphic designer and now venturing onto a new path, web development and design. In my free time I like to be with my family and the occassional happy hour with friends (pre pregnancy of course). During the Summer you will find myself and my family at the dirt track, riding dirtbikes.</p>

	<p>Throughout the site you will find goals I have set for myself, photos of my family, and links to my sites. Enjoy!</p>
